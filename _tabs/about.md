# About Me

Hi, I'm **Steven Kelly** — an automation and software enthusiast with a passion for building practical solutions that help organizations and teams work smarter.

Over the years, I’ve worked extensively with **Rock RMS**, **CRM systems**, and built custom automation tools like job alert bots and product scrapers.
I enjoy blending technology with real-world needs, creating efficient workflows, and crafting user-focused solutions that deliver real value.

I’m particularly experienced with:
- Church management software (Rock RMS customizations and SQL reporting)
- CRM and database management
- Automation scripting with Python and GitHub Actions
- Building bots that monitor and integrate external platforms like Discord and Square storefronts
- Lightweight frontend and backend development

Outside of coding, I'm passionate about making technology more accessible and finding ways to solve niche problems through thoughtful, well-built projects.
